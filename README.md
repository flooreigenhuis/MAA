## Multi agent learning assignment

Welcome to our Multi-agent Learning assignment for the Utrech University.

In this practical the goal was to learn skaters, skating on a thorus to avoid collision.
We've implemented a epsilon-greedy reinforcement learning algorithm, that learns the skates to avoid each other.

The settings that can be changed are
* height
* width
* nr. skaters
* angles
* epsilon
* nr. iterations
